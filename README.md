# NPM_Promotional_Restrictions
Portfolio-wide application of the UK NPM for promotional restrictions

This project uses a data science perspective to understand the feasibility of proposed UK Government legislation to restrict in-store price and location-based promotions of unhealthy food and beverage products in England. 

High saturated Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS) products are identified as 'in scope' for legislation according to PHE's calorie and sugar-reduction categories and the Soft Drinks Industry Levy.
The current (2004/5) UK Nutritent Profile Model and a draft new model (2018 NPM) are applied as the bases for promotional restrictions.
Products which fail the NPM will be liable for promotional restrictions, i.e. they must not be placed at checkouts or end of product aisles and cannot be promoted with volume-based price promotions such as 'Buy one get one free', which encourage over-consumption.

Read&process_2004_5NPM applies the current model, Read&process_2018NPM applies the draft new model. The performance of each model is compared in terms of pass-rates and the micronutrient profiles of products which pass and fail.
